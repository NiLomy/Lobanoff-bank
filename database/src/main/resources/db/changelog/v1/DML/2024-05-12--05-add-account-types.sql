    ('PERSONAL', 'The personal account is intended for basic money turnover. These are payroll transfers, self-replenishment, and cash withdrawals for current needs. Virtual, non-cash money is stored on the personal account in the currency selected during registration. This money is managed only by the account holder, and no one else (except in cases provided for by law) I have no right to use them.'),
    ('SAVINGS', 'A savings account is an account where interest is accrued. In fact, it is a "piggy bank" for saving money and passive income. The interest rate on the savings account may change. The advantage of the account is that it has no expiration date. Conditionally, this is a piggy bank with a removable lid - you take out as much money as you need from it and "close the lid" back without harm to the account, while maintaining the ability to deposit additional money.');
